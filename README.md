## Summary
### What I've Learned
#### Better Knowledge at Object Manipulation
In this project, I'm using list of object to store data. I also learned how to create dynamic display of what inside the library. For deleting and updating the books, I bind the object index to the button when I create the book display. So each button can be used specifically to delete or update the object by using key from the button to point the index of the object.
